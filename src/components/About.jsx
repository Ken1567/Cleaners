        Cleaners® is so much more than just a home cleaning service. We are a company dedicated to giving
        our customers back the time they deserve to enjoy the things they love. We put The Extra In Your Ordinary ®, 
        restoring balance to your life by taking care of your home. Life flies by in the blink of an eye, 
        so it is crucial to stop and enjoy it. With Cleaners®, you can do just that.
        Our house cleaning services cover every inch of your space. We can freshen up your bathroom, 
        invigorate your kitchen, and restore your bedroom to ensure you have the beautiful and clean home 
        you deserve. We’ll get deep into the corners and crevices to rid your space of any dust, germs, 
        and bacteria to deliver a home that is both spotless and healthy.

        <h3 className="m-1">You Expect A Lot, So We Deliver More</h3>
        <p className="m-2">
        We know that no two houses are the same, so there's no reason cleaning services should be the same, 
        either. At Cleaners®, we take the time to listen and understand your needs. When you avail our services, 
        one of our expert representatives will work with you to create a custom cleaning program 
        that will fit both your lifestyle and budget. If you ever have any concerns or need to make changes 
        to your service, our friendly office staff is only a phone call away.
        </p>

        <h3 className="m-1">The Team You Can Trust</h3>
        <p className="m-2">
        Cleaners® knows that our team members are our greatest asset and we recognize the power of our people. 
        For this reason, we conduct extensive background checks and all applicants are carefully screened so that 
        you can have peace of mind with opening your home to us. This process ensures that the individuals we hire, 
        and those that you have in your home, are truly dedicated to providing you with a job well done.
        <br />
        <br />
        Training is crucial to us, and no team member enters your home without it. In fact, each new employee, 
        despite background or prior experience, is required to attend a comprehensive, week-long training program. 
        It is only upon completion of this program that the new team member becomes certified to clean.
